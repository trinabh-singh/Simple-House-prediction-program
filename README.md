# Simple-House-prediction-program
My first Git Repo.

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook for **house price prediction** using machine learning models.
The goal of this project is to understand and implement the complete ML workflow on a real dataset.

📁 Files in this Repository
- `house_price_prediction.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and predictions
- Dataset file (Excel format) – Used as input for training and testing the models

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
- Linear Regression

🛠 Technologies & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

 📊 Dataset
- It contains multiple features related to house properties like Area etc

📈 Results
- The models currently give **average accuracy**
- Performance evaluation is done using basic metrics
- Further improvements are planned to increace the accuracy.


🎯 Project Objective
